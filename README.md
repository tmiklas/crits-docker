# crits-docker
Docker container builder, fixing issues I found in CRITS repo (Collaborative Research Into Threats - https://crits.github.io)

*IMPORTANT NOTE* - This is a `stable_4` branch that seems to work so far... which is a nice change from `master` that is badly broken at the moment

Usage example:

`docker run -d -p 80:8080 tmiklas/crits-docker`

Default credentials set in the image:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `pass1PASS123!`
